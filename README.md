### How did I make my page?

I started by making the index.md file. Then, I went to https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/tree/master to figure out how to set up the theme and make it look nice. I had to add the '_config.yml' file that sets up some of the basic functinoality of the website. Then, I had to make a folder called '_layouts' with a file called 'default.html' inside, which I copied from the theme source.

I made a folder called 'pages' and added a couple of different pages that I would want on my website, such as 'about', 'contact', etc. and added a .md file for each of them. Then, I went into the default.html file and added some buttons in the top banner to navigate the website.

I made the little icon in the browser tab by generating an image at https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ and placing the files it gave me in the 'assets/favicon' folder. Then, I had to create a folder called '_includes' with a file called 'head-custom.html' and copy the 4 lines of code that the favicon website gave me.
